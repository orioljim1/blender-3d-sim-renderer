In this file I will mention updates that are in mind and would greately improve the renderers.

-improve the automatic material modification to allow for the creation of simple diffuse materials, this would work great for cases wher you want to modify your models to have a uniform color

-ability to render out depthmaps

-convert it and bundle it as an addon

-add more materials types for the soft body simulation

-ability to move the sim and render part to genesis project
